# pong_remake
The game is a simple Pong clone that has some of the features from the original game.

I originally made this program in Unity 4, but lost my data due to a formatting issue. Fortunately Unity 5 is out and I got to
remake the game and learn about some of the changes :)

Current features:
- Two players can play
- Ball physics should function as intended (very simply).
- Some neato colors are used.
- Ball auto-starts

Future plans to the project:
- I'd like to re-spawn the ball after someone wins. 
- Maybe add a scoreboard.
- Collisions could be handled better when bouncing balls from angles. 
- Add a MouseEvent to start the game, rather than an auto-start occurring. 
- AI? Maybe AI - I'd have to investigate into this more.
